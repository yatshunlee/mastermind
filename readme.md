# Mastermind Gym Env (CLI Version)


### Rules
OBJECTIVE: You must crack the secret code in the fewest number of guesses.

1. There are 8 turns in total. You must guess it correctly within 8 guesses.

2. There are in total 6 numbers (1-6). It can be a repeatable pattern of 4 digits out of the 6 numbers.

3. After each guess, the terminal will show how many #red and #white you got:
 - Red: Correct number and position
 - White: Correct number but not in the correct location.

4. You modify your answer accordingly after each round and try to make a right guess of the code.
