## Rule
OBJECTIVE: You must break the secret code in the fewest number of guesses.

1. There are 8 turns in total. You must guess it correctly within 8 guesses.

2. There are in total 6 numbers (0-5). You have to make a repeatable pattern of 4 digits out of the 6 numbers.

3. After each guess, the key plug will show how many #red and #white:
 - Red: Correct number and position
 - White: Correct number but not in the correct location.
